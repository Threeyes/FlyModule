Unity-Free-Flight
=================

A Unity Package to provide bird-like flight to Unity Game Objects.

###Description

Have you ever wanted to fly from a [birds perspective](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3QrhdfLCO8 "Youtube of GoPro mounted on an Eagle in flight")? To soar through a canyon, stalking your prey from above, waiting for the right time to fold wings, dive, and strike! Maybe you need a fast travel system for your RPG, and you want to give your players more than just a pre-scripted flight path, to explore your expansive world from above. 

You've come to the right place!

Free Flight is designed to add a realistic layer of slow-moving flight to Unity. That means the ability to flap, wing-fold dive, barrel roll, flare -- anything a bird is able to do this package will emulate. Furthermore, each of these actions is continuous: flight maneuvers change based on the speed and rotation they're executed, allowing for advanced players to learn new and complicated strategies. 

###You have my attention, how do I get started?

###That was neat, now how do I use it in *my* game?
